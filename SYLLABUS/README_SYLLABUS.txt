COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING COURSE OUTCOME:

Course Outcome1(CO1): For the following passage develop UML diagrams and then  implement it as a Java program in accordance with your UML design.  
Passage: College Office collects semester fee and college bus fee for each student. A  clerk at the college office collects the fees from each student. The bus fee is calculated  depending on the distance of the corresponding bus stop from the college. The semester  fee varies depending upon the semester as well as branch of each student. Students are  supposed to pay the fees in full. Economically backward students are eligible for 50%  discount in semester fee. The consolidated fees receipt is issued to each student by the  clerk, which contains the student name, admission number, semester and branch of  student along with details of fees collected. Students can log in and view the details of  fees remitted and dues if any. The system allows students and clerk level login to the  system. Clerk is able to view reports of each class showing status of fees payment of  each student.  

Course Outcome 2(CO2): Write a Java program to evaluate a post fix expression  containing two operands and a single operator using stack. Stack should be implemented  as a separate entity so as to reflect OOP concepts.  

Course Outcome 3(CO3): Write a program to demonstrate the start, run, sleep and join  methods in Thread class.  

Course Outcome 4(CO4): Write a GUI based program with separate buttons to add,  delete and display student details i.e. name, student ID, current semester and branch of  study based on student ID.  

Course Outcome 5(CO5): Using Swing create a JFrame with a JLabel and two  JButtons. Set the texts of JButtons as “Yes” and “No” respectively. Set the JLabel’s text  to the text of the button currently being pressed. Initially the JLabel’s text is blank.
